A Ruby gem for performing shell word expansion using [GNU wordexp][]. It's like [Shellwords][] turned up to 11. Not only does it split taking quotes into account, but it also expands environment variables and tildes, and runs subcommands in \``backticks`\` or `$(dollar parentheses)`.

## Quick start

```
$ gem install wordexp
```

```ruby
require 'wordexp'

cmd = Wordexp.expand("echo 'roof cats' $HOME ~/bin $(date +%F)")
# => ["echo", "roof cats", "/home/queso", "/home/queso/bin", "2022-01-16"]

fork { exec(*cmd) }
# roof cats /home/queso /home/queso/bin 2022-01-16
```

With that you're half way to a [fairly usable shell in Ruby](https://github.com/samsonjs/csc360-a1-shell).
